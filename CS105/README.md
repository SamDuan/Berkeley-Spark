## Overview
This repository includes the tutorials I completed while taking BerkeleyX CS105x - Introduction to Apache Spark at edX. Personal notes and highlights are included.

## Table of content
#### (1a) Spark tutorial
The following transformations will be covered:
* select(), filter(), distinct(), dropDuplicates(), orderBy(), groupBy()  
The following actions will be covered:
* first(), take(), count(), collect(), show()
Also covered:
* cache(), unpersist()

#### (1b) Word count lab: building a word count application  
The code could also be scaled to larger applications, such as finding the most common words in Wikipedia.


## Requirements
[Databricks Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/) is required to run these Apache Spark notebooks.
